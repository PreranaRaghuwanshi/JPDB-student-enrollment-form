# JPDB-student-enrollment-form
This project is a Student Enrollment Form built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. It interacts with the SCHOOL-DB database, specifically with the STUDENT-TABLE, allowing users to add, update, and reset student records. The form ensures that student information, such as roll number, name, class, birthdate, address, and enrollment date, is managed effectively using JPDB API.

**Features**
Add New Student Records: Allows users to input new student data and save it in the database.
Update Existing Records: If the entered roll number already exists, the form will auto-fill, enabling users to modify and update student information.
Form Validation: Ensures all fields are filled before saving or updating the data.
Reset Functionality: Users can reset the form at any stage without saving the data.
Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap, ensuring the form is responsive and mobile-friendly.
